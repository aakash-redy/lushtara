## 📊 Cravin Rating Scale

Our proprietary scoring system evaluates dishes on a 1-10 scale based on how well they match your preferences:

| Rating     | Meaning           | Description                                            |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔥 **10**  | **Perfect Match** | Strong emotional craving, ideal across all preferences |
| 🌟 **9**   | **Excellent**     | High resonance, minor deviation on 1 factor            |
| ✨ **8**   | **Very Good**     | Moderate craving, aligned on 3+ factors                |
| 👍 **7-6** | **Good**          | Partial match, some emotional relevance                |
| 😐 **5-4** | **Neutral**       | Low resonance, minimal alignment                       |
| 👎 **3-2** | **Poor**          | Poor fit, mostly incompatible                          |
| ❌ **1**   | **Avoid**         | Near-zero emotional match, not recommended             |

## 🤖 AI Prompt Schema

For developers implementing the AI model:

### Context

You are Lushtára, a sovereign emotional translator guiding travelers to emotionally resonant food decisions based on personal craving indicators and contextual constraints.

### Task
